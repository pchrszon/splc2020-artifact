# Verify benchmark models generated by build.sh script.

# For each model instance, a single warm-up run is followed by 3 benchmark runs
# (number of runs is configurable below). The log-files containing the build and
# analysis times are written to the logs directory.
#
# Usage: bench.sh <MAX_SIZE> <MAX_FILES>
#   - analyze all models with up to MAX_SIZE stations and MAX_FILES files
